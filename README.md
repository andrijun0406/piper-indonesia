# piper-indonesia

Hi piperians!

I'm piper master for Indonesia, we gonna have some fun learning new things about cloud native and containers.

This project is intended for IT professionals who wants to gain initial experience on developing or deploying app in cloud native practice.

Beware: it's newbie material, for those experienced developers and platform engineers spare us some mercy.

Thanks
